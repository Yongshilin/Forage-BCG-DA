# Forage BCG Data Science Job Simulation Project
This project involved completing 4 tasks as part of BCG's Data Science Job Simulation on Forage. The tasks focused on business understanding, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and delivering actionable insights.

## Tasks Completed
- Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
- Feature Engineering & Modeling
- Findings & Recommendations

## Dependencies
- Language: Python 3.8
- Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Project Overview and Task Insights 
### Task 1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
- Client: PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility concerned about customer churn.
- Approach: Identified necessary client data and outlined investigative techniques.
- Deliverable: Summarized approach in an email to the Associate Director.

### Task 2: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
Files: Forage_BCG_Task_2_EDA(revised).ipynb, client_data.csv, price_data.csv, Data Description.pdf

- Analysis: Investigated price sensitivity and other factors influencing churn.
- Tools: Python and data visualization for trend analysis.

### Task 3: Experimentation and Uplift Testing
Files: Task_3_feature_engineering(revised).ipynb, clean_data_after_eda.csv

- Objective: Built features to test hypotheses and predict churn probability.
- Model: Developed a random forest model for churn prediction with 90% accuracy.

### Task 4: Analytics and commercial application
Files: Task_4_modeling(revised).ipynb, data_for_predictions.csv, out_of_sample_data_with_predictions.csv, Executive Summary Best Practices.pdf

- Outcome: Presented predictive modeling results and provided actionable recommendations.
- Deliverable: Executive summary highlighting key insights.

### Report Summary
- PowerCo has high churn rate 9.7% with 14606 customers. 
- The predictive model performs well for predicting non-churners, but price sensitivity isn’t the main driver. 
- Churn’s key influential factors are Yearly consumption, forecasted consumption, net margin, and time-related factors like tenure and contract updates. 
- Churn drops after the 5th month, suggesting the value of longer contracts. For those leaving within the first 6 months, surveys could help uncover underlying issues.
- Offer discount only to high-value customers with high churn probability.
